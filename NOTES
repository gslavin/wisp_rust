- Why the F64Key type?
    - b/c floats are not totally ordered (Rust is too strict for its own good...)


- change lexer into and iterator
    - can't store Chars iterator in struct
        -iterator borrows from String and string must have longer lifetime
        - Can't store String and chars iterator in same struct
    - Try changing iterator into a BufferedStream


- Add state to eval
    - Create struct for global state
    - Add implementation for eval of defines


- Implement lambdas
    lambda is
        (variables) -> AST of function
